# RSpec Approvals

Approvals are based on the idea of the 'golden master'.

You take a snapshot of an approved object, and then compare all future
versions of the object to that approved version.

See [ApprovalTests](http://www.approvaltests.com) for videos and additional documentation about the general concept.

The original Approvals libraries for Java and C# were developed by Llewellyn Falco.
